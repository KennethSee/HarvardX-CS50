# HarvardX CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
This repository stores the code I wrote for all of CS50's problem sets.

# About CS50
This is an introductory to computer science course offered by Harvard University, primarily taught by Dr. David Malan. I took this course through EdX.

## My reasons for taking this course
I took this course to learn about computer science in a structured manner. While I had some prior experience with Python programming, I wanted to understand software and technology at a more fundamental level. This course was the first time I wrote code in C.
